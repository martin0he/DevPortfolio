          I am a second-year student pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree in
          Computer Science at Northeastern University Khoury College of Computer
          Sciences. My academic and professional journey was always clouded with
          uncertainty, not knowing what exactly I wanted to pursue for the
          longest time. Growing up in eastern Europe, where tech and gadgets
          were luxuries that felt like mystical tools bestowed upon me during
          holiday sales, I was always fascinated with the inner workings of the
          fabric of modern livingâ€”technology. That very passion drove me to
          become a tech lead at Northeastern Electric Racing, as well as
          becoming the founder and Co-President of my school's first
          professional tech fraternity, Kappa Theta Pi. While these are exciting
          and very fulfilling aspects of my daily life, nothing beats sitting
          down after a long day, looking at the work I created, and feeling
          accomplished and proud.

        <Typography>my outlook</Typography>
        <Typography fontSize={15} sx={{ wordBreak: "break-all" }}>
          I'm enthralled by blending the formulaic and technological aspect of
          software with the contemporary design and care put into presenting it;
          searching for balance between ingenuity and creativity. As a child,
          technology and I were truly inseparable and I was infatuated to say
          the least. Over the years, my passion hasn't died down but my tunnel
          vision has been lifted and I've come to realize that the longer I stay
          in the 'tech bubble' the more I miss out on. That's why I actively
          broaden my horizons in fields such as literature, fine art, film,
          cuisine, and philosophy; inherently non-technical areas so I can
          achieve balance akin to "music being the space between the notes". I
          need the 'silence' so my 'sounds' can flourish. I try to draw
          inspiration from my surroundings and my aforementioned interests to
          create inspired work with purpose and meaning.

          Contrary to my current path, hardware was actually what pushed me into
