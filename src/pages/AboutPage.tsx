          <Typography fontSize={15}>
            I am a second-year student pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree
            in Computer Science at Northeastern University Khoury College of
            Computer Sciences. My academic and professional journey was always
            clouded with uncertainty, not knowing what exactly I wanted to
            pursue for the longest time. Growing up in eastern Europe, where
            tech and gadgets were luxuries that felt like mystical tools
            bestowed upon me during holiday sales, I was always fascinated with
            the inner workings of the fabric of modern livingâ€”technology. That
            very passion drove me to become a tech lead at Northeastern Electric
            Racing, as well as becoming the founder and Co-President of my
            school's first professional tech fraternity, Kappa Theta Pi. While
            these are exciting and very fulfilling aspects of my daily life,
            nothing beats sitting down after a long day, looking at the work I
            created, and feeling accomplished and proud.

            my outlook
          </Typography>
          <Typography fontSize={15}>
            I'm enthralled by blending the formulaic and technological aspect of
            software with the contemporary design and care put into presenting
            it; searching for balance between ingenuity and creativity. As a
            child, I was inseparably infatuated with technology. Over the years,
            my passion hasn't died down but my tunnel vision has been lifted and
            I've come to realize that the thing I love doesn't suffice alone.
            That's why I actively broaden my horizons in fields such as
            literature, fine art, film, cuisine, and philosophy; inherently
            non-technical areas so I can achieve balance akin to "music being
            the space between the notes". I need the 'silence' so my 'sounds'
            can flourish. I try to draw inspiration from my surroundings and my
            aforementioned interests to create inspired work with purpose and
            meaning.

            Contrary to my current path, hardware was actually what pushed me
            into the rabbit hole. I remember feeling like Inspector Gadget the
            first time I held a RAM stick and looked at it with a magnifying
            glass as if I had any clue what was going on internally. That
            inquisitiveness grew to assembling desktops for myself and my
            friends and even working for the IT support of a relative's
            business. It was during highschool that I started programming and
            fell in love with the power at my fingertips; anything in my
            imagination was within reach. From basic Java math to web
            development, I've let my imagination soar.

            I want to take my web development skills to the next level, focusing
            on a hollistic approach to the conception, design, and
            implementation of scalable platforms that are both aesthetically
            pleasing and functionally robust. My work is the imprint I leave on
            the world, so I want to be sure it's pretty to look at. Thank you
            for reading my little rant :]
